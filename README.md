## Features

- Play and Queue media links to a KODI media server (https://kodi.tv);
- Sends link to media files from a third party application via Share button;
- Share from Youtube also works, if the Youtube addon is installed in KODI media server.

## Notice

The Kodi webserver is disabled by default and has to be manually enabled by the user. This can be done in Settings → Services → Webserver → Allow control of Kodi via HTTP.
The settings allow to specify a custom port and a username and password for remote access. (http://kodi.wiki/view/web_interface).

This app can send direct video links only. You can find many other programs for Kodi control in Play Market.
