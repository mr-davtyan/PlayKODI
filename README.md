## Features

- Play and Queue media links to a KODI media server (https://kodi.tv).
- Send links to media files from third party applications via share button.
- Sharing from Youtube also works, if the Youtube addon is properly installed on KODI.
- Multiple KODI hosts support.

## Notice

The KODI webserver is disabled by default and has to be manually enabled by the user. This can be done in Settings → Services → Webserver → Allow control of Kodi via HTTP.
The settings allow to specify a custom port, username and password for remote access. (http://kodi.wiki/view/web_interface).

This app can send a link on direct video only. You can find many other programs for Kodi control in Play Market.
